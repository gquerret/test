PCT is a set of [Ant](https://ant.apache.org) tasks for [Progress OpenEdge](https://www.progress.com/openedge), available under the [Apache License version 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

This project was born due to the lack of automated OpenEdge code compiler, and is now the standard build tool for OpenEdge environments. PCT is a command-line based tool, which can be used in a development environment or in continuous integration servers.

PCT was designed and written by Gilles Querret (g.querret at riverside-software.fr), software developer at [Riverside Software](https://riverside-software.fr) (France).
